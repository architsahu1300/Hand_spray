# Hand_spray
Some instructions:-
1. Make sure that your hand is already in front of the camera when the program is starting.
2. Make sure that your sleeves are covered and only your palm is visible.
3. Use the specified area to write/draw anything slowly.
4. With one finger you can write/draw anything.
5. With a closed fist you can move your hand around the screen without drawing.
6. Showing an open palm with all 5 fingers will erase everything on the screen.
Any advice is welcome!
Thank you!
